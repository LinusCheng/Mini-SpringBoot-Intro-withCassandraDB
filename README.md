# Mini SpringBoot Intro with CassandraDB
This project is a mini introduction to help quickly get familiar with Spring framework.

There are two main entries in this project. One is the standard spring boot application. It will start the app and the app will stay as an API waiting for HTTP requests. Another entry in "RunMain" will run all beans and then we can config to exit the app.

## 3 ways to load externalized variables from application.properties

## Use RestTemplate to send http requests

## Use Session to execute cqls

## Exception handling

## Write tests with JUnite and Mockito

## Swagger as a free front end
